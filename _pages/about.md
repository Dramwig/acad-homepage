# About me

I am a student at Southwest Jiaotong University pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering degree with an expected graduation date of June 2025 in Software Engineering.

I have participated in many academic competitions in university, mainly in mathematical modeling and ACM, and won two national first prizes.

With a foundation in mathematical modeling, machine learning, and algorithms, I would like to continue to study artificial intelligence in depth and work on using advanced technologies to solve real-world challenges.

# Awards
